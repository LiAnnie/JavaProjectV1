Why hello there detective. I heard you wanted to ask me some questions?
Well I work as a banker. But why do you ask?
I went to go look at the fine art! My favourite was the Mona Lisa!
Great heavens! That is utterly terrible!
Of course not!? I have no need for a painting like that. 
I am more interested in graphic designing anyways...
It truly is worrying. Do your best detective!
